"""
Workflow Definition for the TubeGuardAI.

This module defines the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that orchestrates the
video compliance audit process. It connects the nodes (functional units)
using the StateGraph primitive from LangGraph.

Architecture:
    [START] -> [index_video_node] -> [audit_content_node] -> [END]
